### **1. Graph Structure (Digitally Drawn Concept)**  
#### **Axes & Shape**  
- **X-axis:** Time (0–120 years, representing ~4 generations).  
- **Y-axis:** Empire’s strength (asabiyyah + civilization power).  


### **2. Phase-by-Phase Breakdown**  
#### **Phase 1: Rise (0–40 Years)**  
- **Drivers:**  
  - High **asabiyyah** (tribal solidarity).  
  - Austerity, shared hardship, military discipline.  
- **Events:**  
  - Conquest of weaker states.  
  - Charismatic leadership (e.g., early caliphs, Mongol clans).  

#### **Phase 2: Peak (40–60 Years)**  
- **Drivers:**  
  - Wealth from conquest → urbanization.  
  - Bureaucracy replaces tribal loyalty.  
- **Events:**  
  - Golden age (arts, sciences, infrastructure).  
  - **Turning point:** Rulers rely on mercenaries, not kin.  

#### **Phase 3: Decline (60–90 Years)**  
- **Drivers:**  
  - Luxury → corruption, loss of asabiyyah.  
  - Taxes rise, rebellions erupt.  
- **Events:**  
  - Civil wars, palace coups.  
  - External threats ignored (e.g., Rome’s border crises).  

#### **Phase 4: Collapse (90–120 Years)**  
- **Drivers:**  
  - Fragmented leadership, economic collapse.  
- **Events:**  
  - Conquest by a new group with high asabiyyah (e.g., Ottomans vs. Byzantines).

### **Additional Notes (Ibn Khaldun’s Theory)**  
- **Asabiyyah** is strongest in **tribal/nomadic societies** (hard living conditions foster unity).  
- **Urbanization weakens asabiyyah** as people grow accustomed to comfort and individualism.  
- **Dynasties typically last 3-4 generations** (~120 years, according to Ibn Khaldun).
